How to install :
(I'll made a tutorial)

- Extract the SDK anywhere.

How to use :
(I'll made a tutorial)
- Open the "LethalSDK_Project" folder though the Unity Hub or directly in an Unity Editor and wait for booting. (First run will be longer)
- When the project is opened in Unity, go in the Mods folder in Unity and copy - paste the TemplateMod folder.
- You must rename this new folder as the name of your mod.
- Open this folder and click on the ModManifest file, change informations about your mod.
  WARNING : the Mod Name and the Mod Folder must be same !
- You can follow how the TemplateMod is made to make your own stuff.
